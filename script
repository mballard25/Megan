Everything up until steps, I can just read in a way

when I get to step 1: 

so I will mainly be using functions within tidyverse so I begin with librarying 
as well as importing my data set

next because the sheet I am using is from a larger data file, I want to rename
my columns on R so that I don't have to alter the original file

I had a lot of issues with this so thie first command is making sure that my
first row is actually recognized as headers

then I had r list my column headers 

I selected the ones I wanted to rename and just to clarify this is RNA seq that 
already had DESeq analysis so the data I have is more manageable and its the
base mean and fold change value with the difference being that the base mean is 
comparing the averaged normalized expression compared to control while the fold 
change refers to the magnitidue of change. In this case it is a log2 FC so 
a value of 1 would refer to a doubling. 

so I will be working with the fold change and p adjusted vlaues since I am curious
about which genes experienced the largest fold change at a level of stat sig

so I rename so I can refer to them easier then use print to double check it is 
reprinted

then I set the appropriate thesholds so i am tellig R that I want
the genes that have a log2FC of at least 1 meaning at least a doubling as well
as a p value of at least 0.05

then here I am assigning variable names 


then next i am actually filtering out the sig genes by 
first excluding NA
then saying I want the genes from this column that are less than the previously 
define 0.05 and an absolute value greater than 1

then here I am creating a new column with only these genes with a columnn that has 
true or false if that conditions are met (with FC and padj)

then from that DF i am making a volcano plot

and this is a little messy and doesn't give me the most direct answer, so I further 
am going to define this with arranging my order is descending so top genes are first
then spllitting my top 10 rows to give the top 10 genes and from
here I can use other data bases to see what thereauptic options there
are and if it is what I expect, a lot of these I know are involved in 
immune response, so exactly what I would expect. R can help me a lot in future
