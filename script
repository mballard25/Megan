Everything up until steps, I can just read in a way

when I get to step 1: 

so I will mainly be using functions within tidyverse so I begin with librarying 
as well as importing my data set

next because the sheet I am using is from a larger data file, I want to rename
my columns on R so that I don't have to alter the original file

I had a lot of issues with this so thie first command is making sure that my
first row is actually recognized as headers

then I had r list my column headers 

I selected the ones I wanted to rename and just to clarify this is RNA seq that 
already had DESeq analysis so the data I have is more manageable and its the
base mean and fold change value with the difference being that the base mean is 
comparing the averaged normalized expression compared to control while the fold 
change refers to the magnitidue of change. In this case it is a log2 FC so 
a value of 1 would refer to a doubling. 

so I will be working with the fold change and p adjusted vlaues since I am curious
about which genes experienced the largest fold change at a level of stat sig

so I rename so I can refer to them easier then use print to double check it is 
reprinted

then I set the appropriate thesholds so i am tellig R that I want
the genes that have a log2FC of at least 1 meaning at least a doubling as well
as a p value of at least 0.05

then here I am assigning variable names 


then next i am further filtering out the sig genes by
