    "text": "My lab is interested in endothelial cells. My interest in particular is the role of endothelial cells in the pathophysiology of sepsis.\n\n\n\n\nProgression of Sepsis\n\n\n\nSepsis begins as a primary infection. Like any other infection, Endothelial cells are a part of your first responders that directly and indirectly respond to pathogens. To that end, endothelial cells become activated where they undergo phenotypic changes to better attack a pathogen. This includes increasing their vascular permeability. So normally EC have tight barrier functions, however, they will diminish those barrier properties in order for leukocytes to extravasate into the tissue to help fight the pathogen. ECs with also increase their inflammatory response so they will be secreting cytokines to further recruit an immune response. ECs will also switch to a more procoagulant state so they can trap the pathogen from entering circulation. However, as the pathogen persists in cases like sepsis , these phenotypic changes that were once helpful in clearing the pathogen become detrimental to the host as the EC is unable to return to quiescence and this increased in vascular permeability gives rise to the vascular leakage driving organ dysfunction in sepsis complications.\n\n In order to look at endothelial cells specifically, my lab uses I am using a Cdh5-driven inducible cre to produce a hemagglutinin tagged ribosomal protein 22. So by tissue harvest follow by immunoprecipitation of the hemaglutein tagged polyribosomes, I can capture the actively translated mRNA from endothelial cells and determine which transcripts are enriched or depleted in endothelial cells based off an enrichment score based off IP-selected mRNA over the total tissue mRNA.\n\n\n\n\nGenetic Model\n\n\nBecause I am particularly interested in sepsis-induced acute kidney injury, I began with renal mRNA from control and sepsis-treated mice.\n\nStep 1: Load Required Libraries and data set to be analyzed\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\ndf &lt;- read.table(\"FSIvsControlBead.csv\", sep = ',')\n\n\n\nStep 2: Set appropriate thresholds for the data I am interested in\n\nfc_threshold &lt;- 1\npadj_threshold &lt;- 0.05\n\n\n\nOptional tidying step: Rename columns in R for simplicity\n\ndf &lt;- read.csv(\"FSIvsControlBead.csv\", header = TRUE, check.names = TRUE)\n\ncolnames(df)\n\n[1] \"X\"                            \"symbol\"                      \n[3] \"B_FSI_vs_Ctrl_baseMean\"       \"B_FSI_vs_Ctrl_log2FoldChange\"\n[5] \"B_FSI_vs_Ctrl_pvalue\"         \"B_FSI_vs_Ctrl_padj\"          \n\nnames(df)[names(df) == \"B_FSI_vs_Ctrl_padj\"] &lt;- \"padj\"\n\nnames(df)[names(df) == \"B_FSI_vs_Ctrl_log2FoldChange\"] &lt;- \"FC\"\n\nprint(names(df))\n\n[1] \"X\"                      \"symbol\"                 \"B_FSI_vs_Ctrl_baseMean\"\n[4] \"FC\"                     \"B_FSI_vs_Ctrl_pvalue\"   \"padj\"                  \n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Set appropriate threshold for data of interest\n\npadj &lt;- padj_threshold\nFC &lt;- fc_threshold\n\npadj_threshold &lt;- 0.05\nfc_threshold &lt;- 1.5\n\n\n\nStep 4: Define significant genes\n\nsig_genes &lt;- df |&gt; \n  filter(!is.na(padj)) |&gt; \n  filter(padj &lt; padj_threshold & abs(FC) &gt; fc_threshold)\n\ndf &lt;-df |&gt;\nmutate(significant = ifelse(!is.na(padj) & padj &lt; padj_threshold & abs (FC) &gt; fc_threshold, \"yes\", \"no\"))\n\n\n\nStep 5: Create Volcano Plot\n\nggplot(df, aes(x = FC, y = -log10(padj), label = symbol)) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = significant), alpha = 0.6) + # Move color here\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"yes\" = \"red\", \"no\" = \"gray\")) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Volcano Plot\",\n    x = \"Log2 Fold Change\",\n    y = \"-log10 Adjusted p-value\"\n  ) +\n  geom_text(\n    data = subset(df, significant == \"yes\"),\n    vjust = -1,\n    size = 3,\n    check_overlap = TRUE\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 6: Create Top Genes List\n\ntop_genes &lt;- sig_genes %&gt;%\narrange(desc(abs(FC))) %&gt;%\nslice(1:10)\n\ntop_genes\n\n                    X  symbol B_FSI_vs_Ctrl_baseMean         FC\n1  ENSMUSG00000089945   Pakap               5.443726 -28.276875\n2  ENSMUSG00000078636  Gm7336             106.543665 -22.042611\n3  ENSMUSG00000116207     Nnt             179.256057 -21.841981\n4  ENSMUSG00000038067    Csf3            1161.682682   8.645900\n5  ENSMUSG00000031762     Mt2           21591.364410   8.327600\n6  ENSMUSG00000058743  Kcnj14               7.970885  -7.009475\n7  ENSMUSG00000062061   Obp2a               9.716260   6.875721\n8  ENSMUSG00000026073   Il1r2              20.287552   6.800744\n9  ENSMUSG00000058427   Cxcl2            1607.268006   6.786794\n10 ENSMUSG00000019368 Sec14l4              43.355829   6.786016\n   B_FSI_vs_Ctrl_pvalue         padj\n1           3.68000e-08 4.320000e-06\n2           9.72000e-27 9.900000e-24\n3           4.53000e-12 9.970000e-10\n4           2.95000e-12 6.780000e-10\n5           1.13000e-98 1.830000e-94\n6           1.44936e-04 4.233525e-03\n7           2.93000e-06 1.767510e-04\n8           2.32000e-06 1.473960e-04\n9           4.79000e-23 3.400000e-20\n10          9.14820e-04 1.807352e-02\n\nggplot(top_genes, aes(x = reorder(symbol, FC), y = FC, fill = FC &gt; 0)) + geom_col() + coord_flip() + labs(title = \"Top 10 Most Affected Genes\", x = \"Gene\", y = \"Log2 Fold Change\") + scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"TRUE\" = \"steelblue\", \"FALSE\" = \"salmon\")) + theme_minimal()"
